"""FastAPI application entrypoint.

Wires up (for the lifetime of the process):
  - a single `AsyncPostgresSaver` (LangGraph's durable Postgres checkpointer)
  - the compiled research graph, built against that checkpointer
  - in-memory registries for active SSE queues / background run tasks

This is what makes `human_review` resumable across restarts: the
checkpointer's connection pool is opened once here, `saver.setup()` ensures
its tables exist, and every graph invocation anywhere in the app uses
`app.state.graph`, which is bound to that one durable checkpointer.
